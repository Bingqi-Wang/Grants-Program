Moonshot has a proven track record of attracting top tier engineers to start meaningful projects. We have a founders community of over 1000 builders and a wide connection among Asia Web3 buidlers. We also has extensive partnerships with China’s top tier investors and media, which can help raise awareness of Polkadot’s capabilities to Chinese developer communities. For instance, we closely partner with Sunny Gao, the Founder and CEO of China’s #1 venture-backed Developer Community, SegmentFault. Through Moonshot’s network of talented and innovative young builders and various resources to empower their ideas, we believe our hackathons will bring quality projects to the Polkadot Ecosystem.
